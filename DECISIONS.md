# DECISIONS

Append-only decision log. Each entry: date, decision, rationale, and
consequences. Newest entries at the bottom.

---

- **Decision.** Hybrid blending is monotonic: ML can raise but never lower a heuristic score (safety property).

- **2026-09-13 — Dedicated `cyberguard` schema + PostgreSQL RLS as the isolation backbone (Phase -1).**
  All application tables moved out of `public` into a dedicated `cyberguard`
  schema, managed by Alembic migrations (introduced this phase; previously
  schema existed only as `Base.metadata.create_all`). The backend connects as
  a dedicated `cyberguard_api` role with `NOBYPASSRLS`; row visibility is
  governed by the `app.user_id` / `request.role` GUCs (session-scoped
  `set_config`, applied per transaction by an `after_begin` event and reset on
  session release). Rationale: database-enforced isolation beneath the
  application filters, so a bug in a query filter cannot leak another user's
  data. Consequences: migrations are now the schema source of truth
  (`create_all` remains as checkfirst bootstrap for SQLite tests, which run
  schema-free via `schema_translate_map`); unauthenticated requests can read
  nothing from owner tables by construction.

- **2026-09-13 — Owner-scoped tenancy in the active path; organization features frozen, not removed (Phase -1).**
  Personal workspaces are the active product surface: every request resolves
  to `TenantContext{organization_id: None, owner_user_id: user.id, role:
  "admin"}` and all queries filter through `tenant_criteria(model, tenant)`.
  Organization tables, code paths, and the server-mode integration surface
  (`routes_integrations`, `enforcement_engine`, `action_executor`) are frozen
  behind `ORG_ENABLED=false` (501 "coming soon") and reactivate with the later
  Orgs Phase. Rationale: decouple, don't demolish — the user-only path must
  not depend on org membership. Consequences: rows created in personal mode
  carry `organization_id = NULL` plus `owner_user_id`; org-mode data written
  by integrations without `owner_user_id` stays invisible under RLS until the
  Orgs Phase revisits policies.

- **2026-09-13 — Deliberate extensions to the Phase -1 spec (documented deviations).**
  1. **GUC application is lazy (per transaction), not at session acquire.**
     `get_current_user` depends on `get_db`, so the session exists *before*
     the user is known; an acquire-time `set_config` would always see NULL.
     The `after_begin` event applies the GUC at the first execution of every
     transaction, which also covers the JIT user upsert that must itself pass
     the `users` RLS policy. `request.role='authenticated'` is set alongside
     so the app role can read the shared-read tables per spec.
  2. **Shared-read tables also carry an app-role policy** (`response_catalog`,
     `organizations`) — otherwise startup seeding of the response catalog and
     `/auth/me` break under RLS for `cyberguard_api`.
  3. **`response_executions` received `owner_user_id`** beyond the spec's
     column list — it is a first-class personal-workspace table and would
     otherwise be deny-all under RLS.
  4. **Child/join tables** (`recommended_actions`, `incident_alerts`,
     `incident_events`, `organization_members`) got EXISTS-on-parent /
     `user_id` policies — RLS-enabled tables without policies are deny-all.
  5. **`enforcement_policies.organization_id` made nullable** — personal
     workspaces own policies directly with `organization_id = NULL`.
  6. **Migration `0003_rls` creates missing roles** (`cyberguard_api`,
     `authenticated`) so the chain installs on vanilla PostgreSQL, not only
     Supabase; the cutover then only sets LOGIN/PASSWORD.
  7. **Frozen-org 501 uses a dedicated `ComingSoonError` handler** to emit the
     spec'd `{"detail": "Organization accounts are coming soon."}` envelope
     while leaving the global error shapes untouched.

- **2026-09-13 — Backend-mediated signup/sign-in with server-enforced usernames (Phase -1).**
  `POST /auth/signup` and `POST /auth/signin` now proxy Supabase Auth from the
  backend so `username` (`^[a-z0-9_.]{3,32}$`, DB-unique) can be enforced and
  resolved server-side (username → email lookup runs on the service-role
  engine, `app/db/admin.py`, because RLS denies anonymous reads of `users`).
  The frontend installs the returned session via `supabase.auth.setSession`,
  keeping the existing token-refresh flow intact. OAuth users get their
  project row (with an auto-generated unique username) via the JIT upsert in
  `get_current_user`. Rationale: username uniqueness across auth identities
  cannot be guaranteed client-side.

- **2026-09-13 — Gmail connector with own OAuth client, encrypted token vault, honest provider registry (Phase 1-2).**
  Gmail mailbox access uses a dedicated Google Cloud OAuth client owned by
  CYBERGUARD — deliberately separate from Supabase's Google identity provider,
  so login tokens can never be confused with mailbox tokens. Tokens are
  encrypted at rest (Fernet via `CONNECTOR_TOKEN_KEY`) and never leave the
  backend; the OAuth callback authenticates with a single-use expiring state
  row (consumed via the service-role helper) instead of a bearer token, and
  redirects carry only a safe status. The provider registry declares Gmail
  enabled (when configured) and Outlook/Yahoo/iCloud as coming-soon or
  unsupported with explicit reasons — no fake provider success anywhere.
  Rationale: mailbox access is the highest-sensitivity integration the
  platform has, so token custody, audit (`connector_operation_logs`), and
  honest capability reporting are foundational. Mailbox scanning is Phase 3;
  quarantine/sender actions Phase 4; event email notifications Phase 7.

- **2026-09-13 — Mailbox scanning is stateless, deterministic, and analysis-only (Phase 3).**
  Provider messages normalize into `NormalizedMessage` (Gmail MIME/base64url
  parsing lives in the adapter; engines never see provider formats). Scans run
  the existing heuristic + ML engines (phishing, URL, impersonation; media
  attachments are honestly skipped — no binary is downloaded yet) and aggregate
  with the shared `scoring_service` weights. Scan results are computed on
  request rather than persisted, so the reported verdict can always be
  reproduced from the message itself. Enforcement is reported as
  `provider_operation_status = "deferred_to_phase_4"` — the UI shows the
  recommendation and explicitly states nothing was done to the mailbox.
  Overall explanations are generated by deterministic rules (fast, stable, and
  auditable) instead of the LLM, which remains available for interactive use.

- **2026-09-13 — Enforcement executes real Gmail writes with a 5-minute asyncio expiry scheduler (Phase 4).**
  Quarantine is implemented with Gmail labels (`CYBERGUARD-Quarantine` added,
  `INBOX` removed) and release reverses it; sender blocking uses Gmail filters
  (`gmail.settings.basic` scope added to the OAuth consent — without
  re-consent the adapter surfaces `insufficient_scope` honestly). Per-user
  settings (expiry 3h/24h/custom/manual, permanent-delete toggle,
  auto-quarantine toggle) gate every action; nothing is simulated. The expiry
  scheduler is a hand-rolled asyncio loop (no apscheduler dependency) running
  on the service-role engine, and it fails safe: a provider error leaves the
  item quarantined/blocked with `last_error` recorded for retry next pass.
  Extensions to the spec's schema: `owner_user_id` denormalized on
  connector_settings/quarantined_items/blocked_senders (required for the RLS
  owner-policy pattern) and `last_error` columns for honest failure reporting.
  The Phase 3 deferral semantics remain only where enforcement is disabled or
  unnecessary — a successful action now reports `provider_operation_status =
  "success"` with the concrete Gmail operations performed.

- **2026-09-13 — Dual-write security history + audit with actor distinction; chat excluded from permanent history (Phase 5).**
  `record_event` writes one `security_events` row AND a matching `audit_logs`
  row with the same `actor_type` (user | system | scheduler), guaranteeing the
  two ledgers never disagree about who acted. Writers must pass the real
  provider operation outcome — history defaults are success-free by design.
  The review view (`/quarantine/{id}/review`) assembles the ordered event
  chain per message and computes available actions from live state (item
  status, connector readiness, permanent-delete setting) rather than offering
  static buttons. AI chat remains ephemeral: sessionStorage-only under a
  per-tab key, destroyed on tab close, and the assistant's audit entry now
  records the intent class only — chat content is never permanent history.
  Migration `0006` backfills `audit_logs.actor_type='user'`; the history
  backfill script is idempotent against pre-Phase-5 enforcement rows.

- **2026-09-13 — 14-method provider contract with capability gating, and DB-logged email notifications for demo reliability (Phase 6-7).**
  The `EmailProvider` contract was finalized to the Excalidraw 14 methods
  with a `capabilities` property exposing `supports_*` boolean flags; the
  enforcement engine and scheduler resolve providers through
  `get_provider(connector.provider)` and consult capabilities before acting
  (a provider without sender-rule support skips filter creation and says so).
  An in-memory `MockEmailProvider` with configurable failure flags proves the
  engine is Gmail-independent. Notifications deliberately use a DB-logged
  delivery backend as the default: the rendered email is persisted to
  `notification_logs` (status sent/failed, `backend=db_log`), making the demo
  deterministic with zero external dependency; optional SMTP is best-effort
  with automatic fallback. The recipient is always the user-registered
  `users.notification_email` — connected mailboxes are never used for system
  notifications (privacy/spam boundary). `backend` was added to the spec's
  notification_logs columns to record the actual delivery path.

- **2026-09-13 — Workspace-scoped navigation from a single nav source; Log Analysis as the client log-paste feature (frontend).**
  Per the Excalidraw step-1 client/organization split: personal workspaces get
  the six analysis features (Dashboard, Phishing, URL, Impersonation,
  Deepfake, and the new Log Analysis paste-box) plus the email-security
  pages; org-side modules (Account Takeover, Network & API, Alerts,
  Incidents, Response Actions, Audit Logs, Reports, approvals/policies/org
  management) are hidden in personal mode AND route-guarded — the guard
  renders a ComingSoon placeholder instead of redirecting, and the backend's
  501/401 responses remain the second line of defense. `frontend/src/nav.ts`
  is the only nav list; Sidebar and route guards both consume it, so moving a
  feature between scopes is a one-line change. Log Analysis is the
  client-facing "log paste and analyze" feature: it auto-detects auth-log vs
  network-flow JSON, drives the existing detectors analysis-only, and shows
  honest format errors — no sample auto-fills, no fake data.

- **2026-09-13 — Real pytest evaluation harness with online-fetch + mandatory synthetic fallback (evaluation layer).**
  The regression suite (scripts/run_all_tests.py) and the new pytest harness
  (backend/tests/) are deliberately separate: the regression suite guards
  behavior, the harness measures quality at scale (P/R/F1/AUC, band
  separation, Mann-Whitney p, latency percentiles) and never fixes app code —
  findings are recorded in the report instead. Online datasets (SMS Spam
  Collection, OpenPhish) are fetched once, cached (gitignored), and
  provenance-tracked; seeded deterministic synthetic generators are a
  mandatory fallback so the suite runs fully offline at the venue. Metrics
  use an adaptive positive threshold (midpoint of class means) for engines
  whose score ranges sit below 50, and threshold-free AUC as the headline
  metric. The harness surfaced two real calibration findings on first run
  (v2 URL model FPs on benign top-1m domains; per-flow network heuristics
  blind to low-and-slow beaconing) — recorded, not fixed.

- **2026-09-14 — ORG-1 foundation: header-based API keys, org-scoped gateway, salted org names, admin/analyst/viewer RBAC (Orgs Phase).**
  The org-side surface activates as a new always-on `/orgs` router (the
  frozen `/organizations` router stays byte-for-byte unchanged while
  `ORG_ENABLED=false`). Binding decisions: server-to-server auth via
  `org_authorization: <key>` header with SHA-256-hashed, prefix-displayed
  keys (plaintext returned exactly once; SHA-256 over bcrypt/argon2 because
  keys are 256-bit random secrets and validation is an indexed exact-match
  lookup — no new dependency); org names salted on conflict ("Acme Corp" →
  "Acme Corp-2") at the application layer rather than by a DB unique
  constraint (personal workspaces legitimately share the name "Personal
  Workspace"); gateway is organization-scoped
  (`POST /api/v1/org/{org_id}/gateway`, actions `scan_email` / `scan_url` /
  `ingest_log`) so a valid key against another org's endpoint is a 403.
  RLS: all org predicates run through a `SECURITY DEFINER`
  `org_member_role()` function — direct `EXISTS` on `organization_members`
  from its own policy recurses infinitely — with an owner fallback (the
  creator is definitionally an admin) that also survives `autoflush=False`
  flush ordering. `organization_api_keys` SELECT is intentionally permissive
  for the app role because hash validation runs before any identity exists;
  writes are admin-gated at both the RLS and API layers. `organizations`
  itself keeps the baseline app-role policy (tightening it would break
  personal-workspace bootstrap); membership checks at the API layer plus
  real RLS on the org child tables provide the isolation Suite 17 asserts.
  Consequences: the full regression suite (which had been red since the RLS
  baseline cutover — direct-session fixtures never stamped `app.user_id`)
  was brought back to green with test-harness-only GUC fixes plus two real
  RLS bug fixes (integration pipeline and action executor now propagate
  `owner_user_id`; startup policy seeding runs via the service role); org
  events/alerts from the gateway run under the org owner's identity, and
  member-readable org data views are deferred to ORG-2.

- **2026-09-15 — ORG-2: shape-based log auto-detection, alert-plane promotion, manual-decision log actions, realtime via publication filters (Orgs Phase).**
  The Splunk plane classifies ingested logs by payload SHAPE (auth =
  `user`+`ip`(+`status`/`location`); network = `src_ip`/`dst_ip`/`port`/
  `bytes`/`flows`; app = everything else) rather than trusting a
  client-declared type, and runs the matching deterministic detector with NO
  LLM on the ingest path (provider latency/rate limits must never delay log
  ingestion; explanations for promoted alerts use the heuristic fallback).
  Log findings at medium+ are promoted to the alert plane (Event + Alert
  with module account_takeover/network/api_abuse) so dashboards and realtime
  see them. Manual analyst actions on log rows (block_ip, revoke_session,
  isolate_host, escalate_incident, mark_safe) record the DECISION
  (`manual_action_taken` + audit_logs entry, analyst+ RBAC) rather than
  firing enforcement — real targets arrive with ORG-3 connectors.
  Realtime: `org_log_events` (row filter `organization_id IS NOT NULL`) and
  `alerts` (unfiltered — a publication row filter requires the filtered
  column in the table's REPLICA IDENTITY, and alerts.organization_id is
  nullable, so the filter would break every UPDATE; frontend subscribes with
  `organization_id=eq.{org_id}` instead) are added to `supabase_realtime`.
  Demo tradeoff: SELECT policies `TO authenticated` on the two published
  tables let the Realtime subscriber role stream rows; tightening is tracked
  for ORG-5. Org dashboard aggregations run through the service role with an
  explicit organization_id predicate (org rows are owner-scoped in RLS, so
  member sessions would see zero rows); membership is enforced at the API
  layer first. Account Takeover ships as the Coming Soon placeholder per the
  Excalidraw spec; auth-shaped logs are still auto-analyzed on the log plane.

- **2026-09-15 — ORG-3: org mail connectors as infrastructure management, not personal OAuth; pluggable transports without new dependencies; per-server log grouping; graceful disconnect (Orgs Phase).**
  Org mail servers are managed like server assets — a unique-named row per
  server with provider-specific encrypted credentials, its own settings, and
  its own log stream — explicitly distinct from the Phase-2 personal Gmail
  OAuth connector (whose code paths are untouched). Credentials are JSON
  blobs validated against per-provider required fields and Fernet-encrypted
  at rest under the shared CONNECTOR_TOKEN_KEY; plaintext never appears in
  the DB, logs, or API responses (a boolean has_credentials is exposed
  instead). Wire protocol lives behind a pluggable transport registry: the
  shipped SimulationTransport performs real credential validation and
  returns clearly-flagged simulated results (mirroring action_executor's
  honest-simulation pattern), because the prompt's named drivers
  (google-api-python-client, msal) are third-party packages outside the
  frozen dependency set — stdlib imaplib needs no package but the transport
  seam is identical for all three; installing real drivers later is a
  transport registration with zero product-code changes. Logs are grouped
  BY mail server (org_mail_server_logs keyed on mail_server_id, every query
  and UI surface filters per server) because correlating two independent
  infrastructure streams would misattribute connector errors to the wrong
  server. Disconnect is graceful by design: CYBERGUARD stops reading, the
  mail server itself keeps running, and credentials are RETAINED so an admin
  can reconnect without re-entering secrets — deletion is the only path that
  removes stored credentials and the server's log stream. RLS: settings are
  admin/analyst-readable and viewer-blocked at both the API and RLS layers;
  logs reach the owning org through the parent server row's
  org_member_role() predicate.

- **2026-09-15 — ORG-4: role-grouped notification lists with min-role event routing, org-level and separate from Phase 7 (Orgs Phase).**
  Notification recipients are ORG assets, not per-user settings: an
  organization registers MULTIPLE addresses, each assigned to a role group
  (admin/analyst/viewer), and each event type declares the MINIMUM role
  group that receives it (admin → admins only; analyst → analysts+admins;
  viewer → everyone). Defaults: server_down/mail_server_down/critical_log →
  analyst, impersonation → admin (brand-sensitive, admins only by default).
  Wired triggers: mail-server connect failure → mail_server_down, fetch
  failure on a connected server → server_down, medium+ log ingest →
  critical_log, gateway lookalike-domain/display-name-spoof indicators →
  impersonation. Delivery reuses the Phase 7 backend (_deliver: DB-logged by
  default, best-effort SMTP) with per-recipient error isolation, and every
  send persists an org_notification_logs row with per-recipient outcomes;
  a disabled event type produces no sends and no log row (silent no-op).
  RLS: all three tables are admin/analyst-readable and viewer-blocked at
  both the API and RLS layers; writes are admin-only. The Phase 7 per-user
  notification_email paths are untouched — org notifications are a parallel
  system with its own tables, routing, and templates.

- **2026-09-15 — ORG-5: in-app docs with provenance-tracked content + realtime policy tightening completes the org phase (Orgs Phase).**
  The /docs page renders a typed content module (src/docs/content.ts) whose
  examples are mechanically constrained to real artifacts: executed curls
  (recorded in src/docs/PROVENANCE.md), suite-verified outputs, eval-report
  metrics/findings, fixture files, and route transcriptions. The check
  script (frontend/scripts/check-docs.mjs) enforces four invariants — every
  feature guide carries an example, all anchors resolve, audience/minRole
  tags are valid, and every api-reference row matches a REAL route parsed
  from backend routers — and caught two genuine transcription errors on its
  first run (quarantine routes live under /enforcement/*), which is the
  argument for mechanical provenance over prose. Gating: org-audience
  sections badge as "Organization feature" in personal workspaces; minRole
  sections render a reduced set for viewers (RoleGuard-style). Realtime
  tightening (deferred from ORG-2): migration 0012 replaces the permissive
  authenticated SELECT policies on org_log_events + alerts with
  membership-gated predicates through the SECURITY DEFINER
  org_member_role() keyed on auth.uid() (WALRUS), with a personal-owner
  branch for alerts; clean no-op on SQLite/vanilla PG where auth.uid()
  does not exist. Realtime subscribers now stream only rows the calling
  user is entitled to — the demo tradeoff recorded at ORG-2 is closed.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-1: Real-time pipeline infrastructure with Redis + Arq; worker separation (RT Phase).**
  Arq selected over Celery as the distributed task queue: Arq is asyncio-native
  from the ground up, fitting FastAPI's async runtime, SQLAlchemy 2.0 async
  sessions, and asyncpg/aiosqlite without requiring threadpools, kombu, or
  AMQP broker overhead; it introduces only `arq` and `redis` with zero bloat.
  Workers are explicitly split into `gmail-worker` and `email-worker`:
  Gmail ingestion is I/O-bound and bounded by Google OAuth rate limits, whereas
  email threat analysis, ML scoring (XGBoost/TF-IDF), and SOAR enforcement are
  compute/memory-heavy. Isolating them ensures external Gmail quota pressure or
  webhook bursts cannot starve analysis pipelines, and allows independent horizontal
  scaling of analysis workers during high-volume threat bursts.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-2: Real-time pipeline database models, job durability, and scan path separation (RT Phase).**
  1. **Separation of `processed_emails` from `scan_results`:**
     Manual scans (Phase 3) are stateless, user-initiated, on-demand operations that evaluate individual messages or drafts without inbox state tracking. In contrast, real-time push monitoring requires stateful ingestion tracking (history checkpoints, processing stages `received` -> `fetching` -> `fetched` -> `analyzing` -> `analyzed` -> `completed`, signal JSONB caches, and strict message-level idempotency via `UNIQUE(owner_user_id, gmail_message_id)`). Separating `processed_emails` ensures high-throughput ingestion never pollutes or destabilizes the manual audit records while preserving an optional foreign key (`scan_result_id`) when full threat scan artifacts are generated.
  2. **Durable `job_queue` table alongside ephemeral Redis/Arq:**
     Redis and Arq provide ultra-low latency, in-memory job coordination for worker dispatch, but in-memory queues are ephemeral: jobs can be evicted under memory pressure, dropped during Redis restarts, or obscured without auditable operational history. The PostgreSQL `job_queue` table acts as the authoritative source of truth for all worker jobs, recording deterministic job IDs, execution states, payloads, output results, retry counts, and exponential backoff retry schedules (`5s`, `30s`, `2m`, `10m`, `30m`). If Redis restarts or a worker crashes abruptly, the durable table allows unacknowledged or dead-letter jobs to be audited, re-enqueued, and inspected through RLS-isolated admin dashboards.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-3: Thin Gmail Pub/Sub push webhook with deterministic deduplication and rate limiting (RT Phase).**
  1. **Why a thin webhook (<50ms response):**
     Google Cloud Pub/Sub push subscriptions expect HTTP 200/201/204 acknowledgments within tight delivery deadlines (default 10s timeout, with automatic exponential retry on failure). Performing synchronous message retrieval from Gmail or running heavy ML pipelines inside the webhook handler would introduce catastrophic request queueing, timeouts, duplicate redeliveries, and server starvation under high-volume mailbox bursts. The webhook strictly performs token validation, base64 payload decoding, and non-blocking queue dispatch before immediately acknowledging HTTP 200.
  2. **Why deterministic `job_id` (`gmail_sync:{owner_user_id}:{history_id}`):**
     Pub/Sub push architecture is strictly at-least-once: network hiccups, gateway timeouts, or worker acknowledgment delays routinely deliver duplicate push events for the same mailbox event. Using a deterministic job ID guarantees distributed idempotency at both layers: Arq/Redis deduplicates against in-flight jobs, and PostgreSQL's `job_queue` table enforces a unique constraint that immediately returns the existing job without creating duplicate worker executions.
  3. **Why token-bucket rate limiting (Gmail API quota protection):**
     Google Cloud enforces strict per-user rate limits on Gmail API calls (250 requests/second/user). Sudden webhook bursts could trigger HTTP 429 quota exhaustion and cause transient sync failures. An in-memory token bucket per `(owner_user_id, "gmail_sync")` detects exhaustion and automatically enqueues jobs with a 5-second deferral (`defer_by=5s`), smoothing burst traffic while protecting API quota.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-4: Gmail sync worker with history.list discovery and row-locked state updates (RT Phase).**
  1. **Why `users.history.list` over direct message listing (`users.messages.list`):**
     Querying `users.messages.list` with date/label filters requires scanning the user's mailbox and repeatedly evaluating full message lists, which wastes quota, scales poorly with inbox size, and easily misses or misorders messages during rapid delivery spikes. In contrast, Google Cloud Pub/Sub push notifications deliver exact `historyId` checkpoints. Gmail's `users.history.list(startHistoryId=...)` yields an exact, delta-only audit trail of mailbox changes (`messagesAdded`) since the checkpoint. This minimizes Gmail API quota consumption, drastically lowers latency, and guarantees exact-delta ingestion.
  2. **Why `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row locks on `gmail_accounts`:**
     Gmail push notifications arrive frequently during active email sessions, often resulting in concurrent webhook delivery and multiple worker processes attempting to sync the same mailbox simultaneously. Without database row locks, concurrent sync tasks would encounter race conditions where an older sync execution could overwrite `last_history_id` with an earlier checkpoint (lost update) or fetch overlapping messages redundantly. A `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock serializes sync execution for a given mailbox while allowing independent mailboxes to process in parallel. Combined with monotonic history ID comparisons (`new > old`), this ensures mailbox state always progresses forward without regression.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-5: Email fetch worker with MIME parsing, content normalization, and poison pill protection (RT Phase).**
  1. **Reusing Phase-2/3 `NormalizedMessage` Parser over duplicate MIME parsing logic:**
     Email MIME structures are notoriously complex (nested multipart/mixed, multipart/alternative, rfc822 headers, encoded-word subjects, non-standard charsets). Duplicating MIME parsing in the worker would create dual maintenance liabilities, inconsistent behavior between manual mailbox scanning (Phase 3) and real-time push ingestion, and subtle security bugs. The worker strictly reuses `gmail_provider._normalize(message_id, raw_message)`, generating a uniform `NormalizedMessage` schema across the entire platform while stripping script/style blocks and sanitizing HTML content into safe plain text.
  2. **Poison pill isolation via `NonRetryableError` and immediate `dead_letter`:**
     Malicious actors or malformed payloads can easily produce pathological inputs (e.g. 50MB attachments, corrupted MIME trees). If handled naively with standard exponential backoff retries, poison pill payloads consume worker threadpools, block Redis queues, and exhaust rate limits, starving healthy accounts. By enforcing strict limits (`MAX_EMAIL_BYTES=10_000_000`, `MAX_BODY_CHARS=200_000`, `MAX_URLS=100`, `MAX_MIME_PARTS=100`, `FETCH_TIMEOUT_S=30`) and raising `NonRetryableError("size_exceeded")`, unrecoverable jobs are routed directly to `dead_letter` status with `retry_count = max_retries` and `processed_emails.processing_status = 'failed'`. This immediately frees the worker queue and enables subsequent healthy jobs to execute without delay.
  3. **Metadata-only attachments and zero content downloads:**
     Real-time email analysis must not download attachment payloads over the wire during ingestion. The fetch worker reads attachment metadata only (`filename`, `mime_type`, `size`, `attachment_id`) into `signals`, avoiding heavy network transfers, storage bloat, and inadvertent execution risks.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-6: Email analysis worker reusing detection engines and linking shared scan results (RT Phase).**
  1. **Reusing existing detection engines (single source of truth):**
     Threat detection logic (phishing heuristic indicators, domain lookalike matching, URL entropy and reputation parsing, executive impersonation heuristics, and SPF/DKIM/DMARC auth validation) must remain 100% consistent across all entry points in the system (interactive analysis endpoints, batch manual mailbox scanning, server-side gateway integrations, and real-time background worker pipelines). Creating worker-specific threat detectors would lead to divergent verdicts, duplicate maintenance burdens, and subtle false-positive/false-negative drift. The analysis worker strictly imports and evaluates `analyze_email_heuristics`, `analyze_url_heuristics`, `analyze_impersonation_heuristics`, and the trained XGBoost ML predictors (`predict_email`, `predict_url`) with monotonic score blending (`max(heuristic, 0.45*heuristic + 0.55*ml)`), ensuring unified analytical integrity across the entire platform.
  2. **Linking `processed_emails` to the shared `scan_results` table:**
     While `processed_emails` acts as the stateful ingestion ledger (handling idempotency, history checkpoints, and multi-stage lifecycle states `received` -> `fetching` -> `fetched` -> `analyzing` -> `analyzed` -> `completed`), analysts and downstream SOAR enforcement workflows (quarantine, user review, security history, SIEM reporting) expect a standard, uniform `scan_results` schema regardless of whether an email was scanned on-demand via Phase-3 mailbox scanning or ingested autonomously in real time via Pub/Sub push notifications. Storing the final verdict, risk score, detailed indicator breakdown, and synthesized explanation in `scan_results` and linking `processed_emails.scan_result_id` allows existing dashboard, review, and enforcement features to operate seamlessly without dual query paths.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-7: Realtime-first frontend subscriptions with 60s polling fallback and zero disruptive error toasts (RT Phase).**
  1. **Realtime-first push architecture via user-scoped Supabase channels:**
     To achieve a sub-3-second end-to-end latency experience from the moment Gmail receives an email to the moment it appears in the Quarantine Queue, the frontend connects directly to Supabase Realtime via the `user:{userId}` broadcast channel. When threat analysis finishes, `email_analyzed` broadcast events immediately prepend new quarantined messages to the top of the queue with an attention-guiding highlight animation, auto-scroll critical arrivals into view if the user is near the top of the screen, and increment the live count badge in the sidebar without requiring disruptive full-page refreshes.
  2. **Graceful degradation to 60s polling fallback without user-facing errors:**
     Websockets and external realtime channels are inherently susceptible to transient network disconnections, corporate firewall restrictions, token expirations, and offline local development environments without configured Supabase credentials. Rather than surfacing jarring error toasts or blocking the interface, `useRealtimeEmails` initiates a 5-second graceful connection timeout. If subscription does not succeed within 5 seconds or encounters channel error states, the hook automatically flips to an unobtrusive 60-second polling fallback reusing the existing quarantine list endpoint. The UI status pill transparently indicates amber `POLLING` with an informative tooltip, keeping user data consistently fresh while maintaining a silent, error-free user experience. Upon socket reconnection, realtime subscriptions resume and polling timers are cleanly disposed.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-8: Watch renewal and reconciliation scheduled workers as safety nets for Pub/Sub (RT Phase).**
  1. **Why 4x daily watch renewal (7-day expiry buffer):**
     Google Cloud Gmail `users.watch` subscriptions automatically expire after 7 days (604,800 seconds). If a subscription lapses without renewal, Google silently stops publishing push notifications to the Cloud Pub/Sub topic, halting all real-time ingestion until manually reconnected. A naive once-per-week or daily cron poses high operational risk if a single renewal fails due to transient network or Google 5xx errors. Scheduling `renew_watches` 4 times daily (`00:00`, `06:00`, `12:00`, `18:00`) with a 24-hour expiration lookahead (`watch_expiration < now() + 24h`) ensures any watch nearing expiration has multiple renewal opportunities and buffers against temporary Google Cloud or network outages.
  2. **Why periodic reconciliation (Pub/Sub drops messages if queues are down):**
     While Google Cloud Pub/Sub push delivery is resilient, it guarantees delivery only within topic retention windows and will discard or dead-letter unacknowledged messages during extended downstream worker downtime, Redis backlog spikes, or firewall resets. Relying solely on push notifications leaves mailboxes vulnerable to silent desynchronization. The `reconcile_stuck_accounts` cron job runs twice hourly (`:15`, `:45`), checking for active accounts that have not synced in over 2 hours and transiently errored accounts (excluding fatal `reauth_required` or `scope_error`). By dispatching deterministic `gmail_sync:{owner_user_id}:reconciliation` jobs, the system automatically catches up missed message deltas via Gmail's `history.list` API, providing an autonomous self-healing safety net without full-mailbox polling overhead.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-9: Observability with structured JSON logs, correlation ID propagation, and Prometheus metrics (RT Phase).**
  1. **Why structured JSON logs (machine-parseable aggregation):**
     Plain-text logs require brittle regular expressions to parse across distributed workers and are prone to truncation or formatting variations. Structured JSON formatting guarantees that every emitted log entry is deterministic, machine-parseable, and immediately ingestible by centralized log aggregation pipelines (e.g. Grafana Loki, Datadog, Elastic/ELK) without custom parsing rules. Every record standardizes fields (`timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `message`, `correlation_id`, `job_id`, `job_type`, `user_id`, `worker_name`). Crucially, the sensitive data filter sanitizes OAuth access/refresh tokens (`ya29.*`, `1//*`), email bodies, and raw attachment payloads at log emission time, guaranteeing that credential leaks or PII exposure cannot occur in centralized log sinks.
  2. **Why correlation IDs across distributed worker boundaries:**
     A single inbound Gmail push notification triggers an asynchronous pipeline across multiple discrete processes and queues: `routes_gmail_webhook` (FastAPI) -> `gmail_sync` (gmail-worker) -> `email_fetch` (email-worker) -> `email_analysis` (email-worker) -> `ScanResult` / Supabase Realtime broadcast. When diagnosing dropped messages, processing latency, or transient API errors, tracking log lines across decoupled workers is impossible without a unified trace identifier. Propagating `correlation_id` via `contextvars.ContextVar` across the job lifecycle binds all downstream log lines, service queries, and client calls to a single traceable thread without leaking state across concurrent async tasks, and automatically clears upon job completion.
  3. **Why Prometheus metrics (`/metrics` export):**
     Prometheus exposition format is the universal open standard for cloud-native observability, supported natively by Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry collectors, and Grafana. Exposing counters, histograms, and gauges at `/metrics` provides real-time visibility into ingestion volume (`gmail_events_received_total`), job outcomes (`gmail_sync_jobs_total`, `email_fetch_jobs_total`, `email_analysis_jobs_total`), worker latency distributions (`job_processing_duration_seconds`), queue backlogs (`queue_depth`), and third-party quota degradation (`gmail_api_errors_total`). Dimensional metric labels enable granular alerting and dynamic dashboarding without high-overhead query aggregation on the transactional database.

- **2026-09-16 — RT-10: Dead letter queue ops dashboard, retry/backoff tuning, and poison message visibility (RT Phase).**
  1. **Why immediate dead_letter for authentication errors (`GmailAuthError` / HTTP 401):**
     When Google returns an HTTP 401 unauthorized or invalid grant response, the OAuth access and refresh tokens have either expired, been explicitly revoked by the end-user, or had their scopes altered in Google Cloud console. Retrying an authentication failure with exponential backoff is entirely futile: absent explicit user re-authentication via the OAuth consent flow, the request will fail 100% of the time. Repeated retries needlessly consume worker pool concurrency, waste outbound network bandwidth, spam upstream Google API endpoints, and delay healthy user tasks. Routing `GmailAuthError` immediately to `dead_letter` on first failure (`retry_count=0`) halts useless retry loops, updates account status to `error: reauth_required`, and surfaces actionable visibility in the DLQ dashboard so administrators or users can re-authorize.
  2. **Why jitter on rate limit backoff (`GmailRateLimitError` / HTTP 429):**
     When upstream Gmail API quota is exhausted across high-throughput organizations, multiple workers querying the same mailbox or shared API project receive HTTP 429 simultaneously. If all workers retry using deterministic exponential delays (e.g. exactly 30s, 5m, 30m, 2h, 6h), they wake up and execute at the exact same millisecond, creating synchronized retry spikes ("thundering herd" problem) that instantly overwhelm Google's quota token buckets and trigger immediate secondary 429 rate limit rejections. Injecting ±10% random uniform jitter (`delays[idx] * uniform(0.9, 1.1)`) desynchronizes worker wakeups, smoothing retry traffic across a wider temporal window and maximizing the probability of successful quota consumption.
  3. **Why soft-delete (`status='deleted'`) over hard row deletion:**
     Dead letter queue entries represent security and operational forensic artifacts. Hard-deleting rows via `DELETE FROM job_queue` would destroy the execution history, payload parameters, error stack traces, and tenant attribution, creating severe compliance gaps for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA audit standards. Marking jobs as `status='deleted'` immediately cleans them from active DLQ dashboard listings and operational queue metrics while immutably preserving the row and recording a `manual_dlq_delete` entry in `audit_logs` for auditability, post-mortem analysis, and forensic timeline reconstruction.
