# CYBERGUARD Deployment & Scalability

## 1. Local Development Setup

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, Node 18+, a Supabase project (section 3).

```bash
# --- Backend ---
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env               # then fill in the values from section 4
# one-time: execute db/schema.sql in the Supabase SQL editor (see section 3)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
# interactive API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

# --- Frontend (second terminal) ---
cd frontend
npm install
# .env already contains VITE_* values; adjust VITE_API_BASE_URL if needed
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:5173
```

Optional (evaluation harness):

```bash
cd backend && source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/fetch_datasets.py            # downloads URLhaus / Umbrella / UCI SMS
python scripts/generate_synthetic_datasets.py
python scripts/evaluate.py                  # writes evidence/reports/evaluation.{md,json}
```

## 2. Docker Compose Setup

`docker-compose.yml` (project root) starts the two stateless services:

```bash
docker compose up --build
# backend  -> http://localhost:8000  (FastAPI, uvicorn)
# frontend -> http://localhost:3000  (Nginx serving the built SPA)
```

- **backend**: builds `backend/Dockerfile` (python:3.11-slim), loads secrets from `backend/.env` via `env_file`, publishes 8000.
- **frontend**: multi-stage `frontend/Dockerfile` (Node build → Nginx on port 80, mapped to 3000) with SPA fallback routing; `VITE_*` values are injected as build args because Vite bakes them in at build time.
- **Supabase is external and cloud-hosted** — nothing database/auth/storage related runs in Compose; both services are stateless and can be scaled/restarted freely.
- Both services share the `cyberguard-net` bridge network.

## 3. Supabase Cloud Configuration

### 3.1 Schema (current — `cyberguard` schema + RLS, cutover 2026-09-13)

Schema is managed by **Alembic**, not raw SQL. Full cutover record:
[schema_cutover.md](schema_cutover.md). Summary for a fresh project:

```bash
cd backend
uv add alembic   # already in pyproject
export MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:<password>@db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Migrations `0003_rls` (RLS policies) and `0004_email_connectors` (connector
tables + owner policies) create the `cyberguard_api` role (NOBYPASSRLS,
NOLOGIN) and apply all policies; enable login afterwards:

```sql
ALTER ROLE cyberguard_api WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<generated-strong-password>';
```

`DATABASE_URL` must point at the **`cyberguard_api`** role (the backend is
fully RLS-scoped) and `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` at the postgres/service role
(migrations + RLS tests only). Realtime publication for the `cyberguard`
schema is deferred to the dashboard phase.

### 3.2 Legacy notes

1. **Create the project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com); note the project URL.
2. **Realtime**: was enabled for the old `public.alerts` table; the `cyberguard`
   schema publication arrives with the dashboard phase.
3. **Storage**: create a **private** bucket named `cyberguard-media` (Storage → New bucket → Private).
4. **Keys**: copy the Project URL, **anon** key and **service role** key from *Project Settings → API*.

## 4. Environment Variables

Backend (`backend/.env`, loaded by `app/core/config.py`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Public anon key — used **only** to verify user JWTs (`app/core/security.py`) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Privileged key — storage writes only; **backend-only, never commit** |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Application DSN — the **`cyberguard_api`** role (`NOBYPASSRLS`); every query is RLS-scoped by the `app.user_id` GUC |
| `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` | Service/postgres DSN — Alembic migrations, RLS verification, pre-auth username lookups; falls back to `DATABASE_URL` |
| `ORG_ENABLED` | Organization accounts flag (default `false` = frozen, endpoints answer 501 coming soon) |
| `GOOGLE_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` | CYBERGUARD's own Google OAuth client for Gmail (Supabase Google login is identity-only) |
| `GOOGLE_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI` | `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/connectors/gmail/callback` (register in Google Cloud) |
| `FRONTEND_CONNECTORS_URL` | Where the OAuth callback redirects the browser (default `http://localhost:5173/email-connectors`) |
| `CONNECTOR_TOKEN_KEY` | Fernet key encrypting Gmail tokens at rest — see `docs/email_connectors.md` for generation |
| `CONNECTOR_OAUTH_STATE_TTL_SECONDS` | OAuth state lifetime (default 600, single-use) |
| `GMAIL_CONNECTOR_ENABLED` | Gmail connector flag (default `true`; requires the OAuth client + token key) |
| `API_V1_PREFIX` | Route prefix (default `/api/v1`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed browser origins |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter key; empty disables LLM and activates the fallback explanation |
| `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | Model id (default `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`) |

Frontend (`frontend/.env`, Vite build-time):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_USE_MOCK` | `false` = live backend + Supabase Auth; anything else = self-contained mock mode |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Backend base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL (browser client) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Anon key only — the service role key must never appear in the frontend |

## 5. Scalability Notes

**Backend (stateless by design)**
- The FastAPI app holds no in-process state beyond cached singletons (settings, Supabase/OpenRouter clients), so it scales horizontally: run multiple uvicorn workers (`--workers 4`) or replicas behind any load balancer. All shared state lives in Supabase.
- Heuristic detectors are pure CPU functions measured at **< 10 ms p95** on the evaluation set (`evidence/reports/evaluation.json`); the dominant latency is the OpenRouter call (15 s timeout, capped by `httpx.Timeout`). Scale-out plus the built-in LLM fallback keeps alert pipelines responsive even under LLM degradation.
- Long-running media forensics (video frame sampling) and future ML inference are natural candidates to move behind a task queue; today `FastAPI BackgroundTasks` is the designated extension point (no Celery/Redis in the stack).

**Supabase (managed, auto-scaled control plane)**
- Postgres instances scale vertically via project tiers; connection pooling (Supavisor/pgBouncer) absorbs bursty read traffic from the dashboard aggregation endpoint, which deliberately does Python-side grouping over bounded result sets.
- Storage and Auth are managed services and scale transparently.
- Realtime broadcast fan-out for the `alerts` table is handled by Supabase Realtime; clients self-subscribe to the `cyberguard-alerts` channel, so additional frontend replicas need no coordination.
- Database scaling path: read replicas for dashboard queries, partitioning `events`/`audit_logs` by `created_at`, and moving hot aggregates into materialized views if row counts grow beyond the prototype's assumptions.

**Frontend**
- The SPA is served by Nginx from immutable build assets — scale by adding replicas/CDN in front of it; there is no server-side session state (Supabase JWTs live in the browser).
